# amiMonitor
This is a new colaboration of asterisk AMI with PHP. 

I Will improve this code and 
write the way to use later. But if you only read this code, mainly `monitorManager.php` or run `php monitorManager.php`, You can use.

# Configuration

1) Copy the `config.ini.sample` to `config.ini` and put your configs
2) Run `php src/amiMonitor.php`
